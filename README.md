# 3d Tic-Tac-Toe
A 3d implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java. 

This project was a collaboration with 2 other students, Reeve Lood and Nate Hausfater. The Professor did not want us forking directly into the class repos, but since each group had unique project ideas he didn't mind us uploading our work.

My contributions were the 3d board generation and visualization, and the classes representing the model of the game. The Shop and various controllers/fxml files were mostly done by my group members, although I did help link together the backend models with the gameplay controllers.
